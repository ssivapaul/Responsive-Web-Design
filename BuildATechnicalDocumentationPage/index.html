          The C programming language is a general purpose programming language,
          which relates closely to the way machines work. Understanding how
          computer memory works is an important aspect of the C programming
          language. Although C can be considered as "hard to learn", C is in
          fact a very simple language, with very powerful capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          C is a very common language, and it is the language of many
          applications such as Windows, the Python interpreter, Git, and many
          many more.
        </p>

        <p>
          C is a compiled language - which means that in order to run it, the
          compiler (for example, GCC or Visual Studio) must take the code that
          we wrote, process it, and then create an executable file. This file
          can then be executed, and will do what we intended for the program to
          do.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every C program uses libraries, which give the ability to execute
          necessary functions. For example, the most basic function called
          printf, which prints to the screen, is defined in the stdio.h header
          file.
        </p>
        <p>
          To add the ability to run the printf command to our program, we must
          add the following include directive to our first line of the code:
        </p>
        <code
          >int main() {<br />&emsp;&emsp;... our code goes here<br />&emsp;&emsp;return
          0;<br />}</code
        >
        <p>
          The int keyword indicates that the function main will return an
          integer - a simple number. The number which will be returned by the
          function indicates whether the program that we wrote worked correctly.
          If we want to say that our code was run successfully, we will return
          the number 0. A number greater than 0 will mean that the program that
          we wrote failed.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this tutorial, we will return 0 to indicate that our program was
          successful.
        </p>

        <header>Variables and Types</header>
        <p>
          C has several types of variables, but there are a few basic types:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Integers - whole numbers which can be either positive or negative.
            Defined using char, int, short, long or long long.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unsigned integers - whole numbers which can only be positive.
            Defined using unsigned char, unsigned int, unsigned short, unsigned
            long or unsigned long long.
          </li>
          <li>
            Floating point numbers - real numbers (numbers with fractions).
            Defined using float and double.
          </li>
          <li>
            Structures - will be explained later, in the Structures section.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The different types of variables define their bounds. A char can range
          only from -128 to 127, whereas a long can range from -2,147,483,648 to
          2,147,483,647 (long and other numeric data types may have another
          range on different computers, for example - from
          –9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 on 64-bit
          computer).
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that C does not have a boolean type. Usually, it is defined using
          the following notation:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>#define BOOL char</li>
          <li>#define FALSE 0</li>
          <li>#define TRUE 1</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          C uses arrays of characters to define strings, and will be explained
          in the Strings section.
        </p>
        <p>
          For numbers, we will usually use the type int. On most computers
          today, it is a 32-bit number, which means the number can range from
          -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
        </p>
        <p>
          To define the variables foo and bar, we need to use the following
          syntax:
        </p>
        <code
          >int foo;<br />
          int bar = 1;
        </code>
        <p>
          The variable foo can be used, but since we did not initialize it, we
          don't know what's in it. The variable bar contains the number 1.
        </p>

      <section id="Arrays" class="main-section">
        <header>Arrays</header>
        <p>
          Arrays are special variables which can hold more than one value under
          the same variable name, organised with an index. Arrays are defined
          using a very straightforward syntax:
        </p>
        <code
          >/* defines an array of 10 integers */<br />
          int numbers[10];
        </code>
        <p>
          Accessing a number from the array is done using the same syntax.
          Notice that arrays in C are zero-based, which means that if we defined
          an array of size 10, then the array cells 0 through 9 (inclusive) are
          defined. numbers[10] is not an actual value.
        </p>
        <code
          >int numbers[10];<br />
          /* populate the array */<br />
          numbers[0] = 10;<br />
          numbers[1] = 20;<br />
          numbers[2] = 30;<br />
          numbers[3] = 40;<br />
          numbers[4] = 50;<br />
          numbers[5] = 60;<br />
          numbers[6] = 70;<br /><br />

          /* print the 7th number from the array, which has an index of 6 */<br />
          printf("The 7th number in the array is %d", numbers[6]);
        </code>
        <p>
          Arrays can only have one type of variable, because they are
          implemented as a sequence of values in the computer's memory. Because
          of that, accessing a specific array cell is very efficient.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="Multidimentional_Arrays" class="main-section">
        <header>Multidimentional Arrays</header>
        <p>
          In the previous tutorials on Arrays, we covered, well, arrays and how
          they work. The arrays we looked at were all one-dimensional, but C can
          create and use multi-dimensional arrays. Here is the general form of a
          multidimensional array declaration:
        </p>
        <code>type name[size1][size2]...[sizeN]; </code>
        <p>For example, here's a basic one for you to look at -</p>
        <code>int foo[1][2][3]; </code>
        <p>or maybe this one -</p>
        <code>char vowels[1][5] = {{'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}}; </code>
        <p>
          Two-dimensional Arrays The simplest form of multidimensional array is
          the two-dimensional array. A two-dimensional array is pretty much a
          list of one-dimensional arrays. To declare a two-dimensional integer
          array of size [ x ][ y ], you would write something like this −
        </p>
        <code>type arrayName [x][y];</code>
        <p>
          Where type can be any C data type (int, char, long, long long, double,
          etc.) and arrayName will be a valid C identifier, or variable. A
          two-dimensional array can be considered as a table which will have [ x
          ] number of rows and [ y ] number of columns.
        </p>
        <p>
          And honestly, you really don't have to put in a [ x ] value really,
          because if you did something like this -
        </p>
        <code
          >char vowels[][5] = { {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'}, {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o',
          'u'} };
        </code>

        <p>
          the compiler would already know that there are two "dimensions" you
          could say, but, you NEED a [ y ] value!! The compiler may be smart,
          but it will not know how many integers, characters, floats, whatever
          you're using you have in the dimensions. Keep that in mind.
        </p>
        <p>Initializing Two-Dimensional Arrays</p>
        <p>
          Multidimensional arrays may be used by specifying bracketed[] values
          for each row. Below is an array with 3 rows and each row has 4
          columns. To make it easier, you can forget the 3 and keep it blank,
          it'll still work.
        </p>
        <code
          >int a[3][4] = { {0, 1, 2, 3} , /* initializers for row indexed by 0
          */ {4, 5, 6, 7} , /* initializers for row indexed by 1 */ {8, 9, 10,
          11} /* initializers for row indexed by 2 */ };</code
        >
        <p>
          The inside braces, which indicates the wanted row, are optional. The
          following initialization is the same to the previous example −
        </p>
        <code>int a[3][4] = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11};</code>
        <p>Accessing Two-Dimensional Array Elements</p>
        <p>
          An element in a two-dimensional array is accessed by using the
          subscripts, i.e., row index and column index of the array. For example
          −
        </p>
        <code>int val = a[2][3];</code>
        <p>
          The above statement will take the 4th element from the 3rd row of the
          array.
        </p>

        <p>
          In life, we all have to make decisions. In order to make a decision we
          weigh out our options and so do our programs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is the general form of the decision making structures found in C.
        </p>
        <code
          >int target = 10;<br />if (target == 10) {
          <br />&emsp;&emsp;printf("Target is equal to 10"); <br />}
        </code>
        <p>
          The if statement allows us to check if an expression is true or false,
          and execute different code according to the result.
        </p>
        <p>
          To evaluate whether two variables are equal, the == operator is used,
          just like in the first example. Inequality operators can also be used
          to evaluate expressions. For example:
        </p>
        <code
          >int foo = 1;<br />
          int bar = 2;<br />

          if (foo &lt; bar) {<br />&emsp; printf("foo is smaller than bar.");<br />
          }<br />

          if (foo &gt; bar) {<br />&emsp; printf("foo is greater than bar.");<br />
          }</code
        >
        <p>
          We can use the else keyword to execute code when our expression
          evaluates to false.
        </p>
        <code
          >int foo = 1;<br />
          int bar = 2;<br />

          if (foo &lt; bar) {<br />&emsp; printf("foo is smaller than bar.");<br />
          } else {<br />&emsp; printf("foo is greater than bar.");<br />
          }</code
        >
        <p>
          Sometimes we will have more than two outcomes to choose from. In these
          cases, we can "chain" multiple if else statements together.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="Strings" class="main-section">
        <header>Strings</header>
        <p>
          Strings in C are actually arrays of characters. Although using
          pointers in C is an advanced subject, fully explained later on, we
          will use pointers to a character array to define simple strings, in
          the following manner:
        </p>
        <code>char * name = "John Smith";</code>
        <p>
          This method creates a string which we can only use for reading. If we
          wish to define a string which can be manipulated, we will need to
          define it as a local character array:
        </p>
        <code>char name[] = "John Smith";</code>
        <p>
          This notation is different because it allocates an array variable so
          we can manipulate it. The empty brackets notation [] tells the
          compiler to calculate the size of the array automatically. This is in
          fact the same as allocating it explicitly, adding one to the length of
          the string:
        </p>
        <code
          >char name[] = "John Smith";<br />
          /* is the same as */<br />
          char name[11] = "John Smith";</code
        >
        <p>
          The reason that we need to add one, although the string John Smith is
          exactly 10 characters long, is for the string termination: a special
          character (equal to 0) which indicates the end of the string. The end
          of the string is marked because the program does not know the length
          of the string - only the compiler knows it according to the code.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can use the printf command to format a string together with other
          strings, in the following manner:
        </p>
        <code
          >char * name = "John Smith"; int age = 27; /* prints out 'John Smith
          is 27 years old.' */ printf("%s is %d years old.\n", name, age);</code
        >
        <p>
          Notice that when printing strings, we must add a newline (\n)
          character so that our next printf statement will print in a new line.
        </p>
        <p>
          The function 'strlen' returns the length of the string which has to be
          passed as an argument:
        </p>
        <code>char * name = "Nikhil"; printf("%d\n",strlen(name));</code>
        <p>
          The function strncmp compares between two strings, returning the
          number 0 if they are equal, or a different number if they are
          different. The arguments are the two strings to be compared, and the
          maximum comparison length. There is also an unsafe version of this
          function called strcmp, but it is not recommended to use it. For
          example:
        </p>
        <code
          >char * name = "John";<br />

          if (strncmp(name, "John", 4) == 0) {<br />&emsp; printf("Hello,
          John!\n");<br />
          } else {<br />&emsp; printf("You are not John. Go away.\n");<br />
          }
        </code>
